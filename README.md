# DCVpHluorin_toolseet
DCV-pHluorin toolset implement different functionality for the analysis of neuropeptide labelled with pHluorin. In particular it was developed and tested using NPY-pHluorin. The idea of this toolset is to provide a semi-automatic analysis of dense-core vesicles fusion events in primary neuronal culture. It is designed to simplify the analysis and to provide a controlled cross platform workflow for the detection and analysis of fusion of dense-core vesicles.
